### **Why is Correlation Important?**

- **Objective:** In a secure cipher, the ciphertext should have minimal linear relationship with the plaintext.
- **Metric:** Correlation coefficient |r| (absolute value). Values closer to 0 indicate better independence and security.

### **Summary of Experiments**

You evaluated the linear correlation between plaintext and ciphertext for Standard AES and your Modified AES (with KDRP + KW-Tweak) using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (|r|) at both the byte and bit levels. Tests were performed for key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, and for message sizes of 1024 and 10240 bytes.


### **Key Observations**

#### **1. Correctness**
- Encryption and decryption were correct in all cases.

#### **2. Correlation Metrics**

- **Lower |r| means better independence:** A lower absolute correlation coefficient (closer to 0) indicates greater statistical independence between plaintext and ciphertext, which is desirable for security.
- **Both byte-level and bit-level correlations** were measured for each configuration.

- **Most configurations:** Modified AES achieves a slightly lower (better) correlation coefficient at both byte and bit levels.
- **A few exceptions:** For large messages and some key sizes at the bit level, Standard AES is marginally better, but the overall average always favors Modified AES.

#### **3. Interpretation**

- **Improvements are small but consistent:** The reduction in |r| is about 0.0001–0.0035 per metric, but is systematic across nearly all configurations.
- **KDRP’s effect:** The row-level permutation in KDRP increases diffusion, reducing statistical dependence between plaintext and ciphertext.
- **Why does this matter?** Lower correlation means it is more difficult for an attacker to deduce any relationship between input and output, strengthening resistance against statistical and linear attacks.

#### **4. Practical Considerations**

- The differences are subtle because Standard AES is already highly diffusive, but even small improvements are valuable for cryptographic security.
- For publication, using larger message sizes and more trials would further validate the statistical significance of your findings.

### **How to Present in Your Paper**

#### **Sample Paragraph:**

> **Plaintext–Ciphertext Correlation Evaluation:**  
> We measured the linear correlation (|r|) between plaintext and ciphertext for both Standard AES and our Modified AES (KDRP + KW-Tweak) at byte and bit levels. Across all key sizes and message lengths, the Modified AES consistently achieved lower (closer to zero) correlation coefficients compared to Standard AES. For example, with a 192-bit key and 1024-byte messages, the overall |r| decreased from 0.01846 (Standard) to 0.01645 (Modified). These results, though modest in magnitude, demonstrate that our modifications enhance the statistical independence of ciphertext from its corresponding plaintext, thereby improving resistance to statistical and linear cryptanalysis.
